## Getting Started
### Building
In Visual Studio 2017 or greater, you can open up the the main flughafen.sln and build the solution directly from within.

##### ToolSet
Framework: Visual Studio 2017 - .NET Framework 4.6.1 - Language C#

##### Dependencies
All project dependencies should be resolved automatically by nuget. The only external library used is NEWTOWNSOFT's json library.

## Design Rational
The project uses .NET's Web API libraries to expose a RESTful(lish) (see criticisms) experience to potential clients. A set of Controllers and Models are used to expose the requested set of functions.

## Criticisms /Improvements Needed
### Criticisms
Criticisms are embedded in comments throughout the project. The UsersController.cs file is especially spiteful.

### Todo
* Much more unit testing
* Support/utilization of http status codes (on internal exceptions thrown)
* Certain items can be better expressed via custom data types (ex: name)
* Seperate the exposed models and datatypes - I really love readonly/const properties, but data model bindings require empty constructors & get;set; enabled props. It would be much nicer if the gui models were better seperated from the actual logic units.

## API
### Get a LIST of users by name
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/users/names/{name}
param:		{name} = name of user desired; case mATterS; exact match required

yields:		LIST of User objects matching that name (including userIds)
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/users/names/lord voldemort -> list of user models, with an entry for 'lord voldemort''s profile
```

### Get a user's profile via userId
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/users/{userId}
param:		{userId} = unique numeric identifier of user desired; you can find this via names func (see previous)

yields:		json model of User object matching that id
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/users/1 -> user model for user id=1
```

### Get a LIST of a user's favourite airports (containing location data)
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/users/{userId}/favs
param:		{userId} = unique numeric identifier of user desired

yields:		LIST of Airport objects favourited by the user
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/users/2/favs -> list favourite airports for user with uid 2
```

### Walk through a user's favorites by its 0 based index number (0-9)
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/users/{userId}/favs/{favnum}
param:		{userId} = unique numeric identifier of user desired
		{favnum} = 0 based index of favourites, from 0-9
		
yields:		Favorited Airport object
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error
		index not found exception on out of bounds error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/users/2/favs/0 ->  favourite airport # 0 for user with uid 2
```

### Add an airport to a user's favorites list
```
HTTP Verb:	POST 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/users/{userId}/{airportCode}
param:		{userId} = unique numeric identifier of user desired
		{airportCode} = the IATA code assigned to airports (ex: IAD for Dulles International) ; see Airports section below

yields:		HTTP 201 on success
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/users/2/iad -> Add airport IAD to user 2's profile as a favourite
```

## Airports

### Get list of supported airports (for getting airport IATA codes)
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/airports
param:		n/a

yields:		list of all airports in database, including name, iata codes, and locations
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error
note: 		this method does not seem to work from chrome; it does work from fiddler + postman!

example:	flughafen/api/v1/airports

```

## Weather

**Weather comes in two flavours; a simple version containing just current conditions:**
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/weather/{airportCode}
param:		{airportCode} = IATA airport code (ex: IAD for Dulles International)

yields:		WeatherReport object containing current weather conditions
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/weather/iad -> get simple weather for Dulles International
```

**or a more opinionated one:**
```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/weather/{airportCode}/detailed
param:		{airportCode} = IATA airport code (ex: IAD for Dulles International)

yields:		OpinionatedWeatherReport object containing current weather conditions
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/weather/iad/detailed -> get advanced weather for Dulles International
```

**You can also directly get the weather from the user's favs list:**

```
HTTP Verb:	GET 
URL:		flughafen/api/v1/users/{userId}/favs/{favnum}/weather
param:		{userId} = unique numeric identifier of user desired
		{favnum} = 0 based index of favourites, from 0-9

yields:		WeatherReport object containing current weather conditions
errors:		500 + json packet with message + stacktrace on error
		index not found exception on favs out of bounds error

example:	flughafen/api/v1/users/2/favs/0/weather -> simple weather for favourited airport # 0 for user with uid 2
```

*If you want the opinionated version, simply swap 'weather' with 'advWeather':*
```
flughafen/api/v1/users/2/favs/0/advWeather
```
